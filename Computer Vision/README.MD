# Computer Vision final project

The goal of this project is to develop an automatic system for image and video analysis
for the game of darts. The system takes an image/a video of the dartboard and extracts the
following information: 
- number of darts (arrows) on the dartboard; 
- the exact position of the darts on the dartboard
